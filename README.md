This full-stack web application was developed for BAE Systems, Inc. and is **currently (2024) deployed in BAE Systems' internal network**.
It displays essential information and statistics for an internal account and password management application, and utilizes existing smart-card SSO infrastructure to provide fully secure admin and user dashboards.

## Contribution
I was given a prompt and some requirements and took the app from **design**, to **architecture**, to **development**, and finally to **deployment**. 
As a solo developer, I self-managed the entire process, ensuring that each phase was executed properly. This involved creating detailed designs using **Adobe XD**, planning the app's architecture, developing both the frontend and backend, and deploying the final product. The project leveraged a full stack of technologies, including React, Node.js, TypeScript, and Docker, to deliver a fully functional and responsive web application.

##  Results
Customers and system administrators using this application save a combined **60 hours / month** or over **720 hours / year** in manual labor.
